This folder contains all calculations and methods used to pick the component values for the SPV1040

->SPV1040_MPPT_Design_Calculations.ods
Not an excel sheet since campus computers has LibreOffice Calc. This contains the parameters of the SPV1040 Design
and calculated values. The green highlighted sections are the inputs/parameters. The purple highlighted sections are
the output of calculations. There is a schematic image attached to the sheet which tells you which values
the sheet is calculating. To understand where these calculations came from, look into the AN3319 Appnote.
